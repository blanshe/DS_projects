    <div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text serif">First, I looked at birth rate of races between 1980 and 2015. I got the data set from National Vital Statistics Reports, Volume 66, Number 1, January 5, 2017. You can find it on page 16. You can find the data set <a href="https://cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_01.pdf">here</a></p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The birth rate has been falling among all race groups, but far more among American-Indian-Alaska natives. They had the highest rate in 1980 but by 2015, they had the lowest birth rate.</p>
