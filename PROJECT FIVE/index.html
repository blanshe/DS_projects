      <p class="body-text serif">I downloaded data set of U.S states unemployment in the first half of 2019 from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. I sorted data and picked states that had highest and lowest unemployment from January to June. </p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Highest unemployment: Alaska, District of Columbia, West Virginia, New Mexico and Arizona were the states with highest unemployment rates. But West Virginia stood out. Why? It registered a significant unemployment rate reduction from 5.2 to 4.4 percent.</p>

      <p class="body-text serif">I then turned to states with low unemployment rate. Hawaii, North Dakota, Vermont, New Hampshire, Iowa were the states with lowest unemployment rate. Vermont stood out in this cluster because its unemployment rate went down from 2.5 to 2.1 percent.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Unemployment in Iowa was static for the first half of 2019. The rate went up in Hawaii from February to June. The rate went up in New Hampshire in June. Unemployment went down in North Dakota in January and February but remained static during the four months that followed.</p>
